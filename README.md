# QM-Calculator
Automated the Quine-McCluskey method for both sum of products and product of sums into a Python calculator

This is a Python 3 implementation of the Quine McCluskey algorithm to simplify boolean expressions from a truth table. Petrick's method is used to further simplify if needed. 

This Python script takes minterms and don't care terms (optional) as input and gives both the sum of products and the product of sums output, and shows each step of the calculation as well. (Input is taken as follows: "m(x, y, z) [+ d(a, b, c)]".)
